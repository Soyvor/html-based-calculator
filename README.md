HTML Calculator

This HTML code creates a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator allows users to enter expressions using the calculator buttons and calculates the result using JavaScript.

# HTML Structure

The calculator is structured using a single div element with the id calculator. This div contains the calculator display and buttons, which are styled using CSS. The calculator display is an input element with the id output that is disabled, so users cannot directly edit the display.

# CSS Styling

The calculator buttons are styled using the .button class, which sets the background color, border, font size, and other properties. The calculator div has a background color, border radius, padding, and box shadow to give it a rounded appearance.

# JavaScript Functions

The JavaScript code defines three functions: addToOutput, clearOutput, and calculate.

addToOutput
The addToOutput function takes a single argument, value, which represents the value to be added to the calculator display. This function is called when the user clicks a calculator button. The function appends the value to the end of the output element's value.

# clearOutput
The clearOutput function clears the calculator display by setting the output element's value to an empty string. This function is called when the user clicks the "C" button.

# calculate
The calculate function evaluates the expression entered by the user and displays the result in the calculator display. This function is called when the user clicks the "=" button. The function uses the eval method to evaluate the expression and handles any errors that occur by displaying "Error" in the calculator display.

# Conclusion

This HTML code provides a simple example of how to create a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code can be easily modified to add additional features or styling
